Explanation of Specifics:

What is a server?
A server is a computer or system that provides services or resources to other computers, known as clients, over a network.

What is the role of the domain name?
The domain name is a human-readable label used to identify a website. It maps to an IP address, allowing users to access websites using memorable names instead of numerical IP addresses.

What type of DNS record is "www" in www.foobar.com?
"www" is a subdomain, and in this context, it's typically a CNAME (Canonical Name) record that points to the root domain foobar.com.

What is the role of the web server?
The web server (Nginx) serves static content and handles HTTP requests from clients, delivering web pages and other web resources to users.

What is the role of the application server?
The application server executes dynamic code, interacts with the database, and generates dynamic content based on user requests. It handles business logic and application-specific tasks.

What is the role of the database?
The database (MySQL) stores and manages structured data required by the application, such as user accounts, posts, settings, etc.

What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website?
The server communicates with the user's computer over the Internet using the HTTP protocol. When a user requests a web page, their browser sends an HTTP request to the server, and the server responds with the requested content.

Issues with the Infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
Since there's only one server, any failure in hardware, software, or network connectivity can lead to downtime for the entire website.

Downtime During Maintenance:
When performing maintenance tasks such as deploying new code or updating software, the web server typically needs to be restarted, resulting in downtime for the website.

Limited Scalability:
With only one server, it's challenging to handle a sudden increase in traffic. Scaling horizontally (adding more servers) would require additional infrastructure and configuration.

To address these issues, one could implement solutions like load balancing, redundancy, and scalable infrastructure using technologies like Kubernetes, Docker, or cloud platforms.
